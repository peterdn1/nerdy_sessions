# Code Review: `frontend/src/components/WelcomePage.tsx`

## Strengths

- **Separation of Concerns:** The component is focused and only handles the welcome page UI.
- **Use of React Hooks:** `useState` is used appropriately for video cycling.
- **Clean JSX Structure:** The layout is clear, with semantic separation of header, main content, and footer.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Consistent use of utility classes for styling.
- **Accessibility:** `alt` attributes are present for images.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Accessibility

- **Search Input:** The search input is missing a label. For accessibility, add a visually hidden label or use `aria-label`:
  ```jsx
  <input
    type="text"
    aria-label="Search for AI impacts, Robotics companies, AI Stock Winners and Losers"
    ...
  />
  ```
- **Button Label:** The "See more" button could be more descriptive for screen readers, e.g., `aria-label="See another robot video"`.

### 2. Performance

- **Video Preloading:** Importing all video files at once can increase bundle size. If these videos are large, consider lazy-loading or storing their URLs in a config file or CDN.
- **Video Key:** If you ever add a list of videos or dynamic video elements, always provide a `key` prop.

### 3. Code Quality

- **Constants Outside Component:** The `videos` array can be defined outside the component to avoid re-creating it on every render:
  ```js
  const videos = [robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4, robot5, robot6, robot7];

  const WelcomePage: React.FC = () => { ... }
  ```
- **Random Index Initialization:** Your use of a function in `useState` for the initial value is good practice.

### 4. User Experience

- **Search Functionality:** The search input is currently static. If you plan to implement search, consider adding a handler or placeholder comment for future devs.
- **Responsive Design:** The use of Tailwind's responsive classes is good, but test on mobile to ensure the video and images scale well.

### 5. Maintainability

- **Component Size:** The file is under 70 lines, which is good. If it grows, consider extracting the header or video section into their own components.
- **Magic Strings:** The placeholder text and button label are hardcoded. If you plan to localize, move these to a constants file.

### 6. Security

- **No direct security issues** in this component, but always validate user input if you implement the search.

## Example: Accessibility & Code Quality Improvements

```jsx
// Move videos array outside the component
const videos = [robot1, robot2, robot3, robot4, robot5, robot6, robot7];

const WelcomePage: React.FC = () => {
  const [videoIndex, setVideoIndex] = useState(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * videos.length));

  const handleSeeMore = () => {
    setVideoIndex((prevIndex) => (prevIndex + 1) % videos.length);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col min-h-screen w-full">
      <header ...>
        ...
        <input
          type="text"
          aria-label="Search for AI impacts, Robotics companies, AI Stock Winners and Losers"
          ...
        />
        ...
      </header>
      <div ...>
        <video ... />
        <div ...>
          <img ... />
          <h1 ...>Change is coming.....</h1>
          <button
            className="px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 transition"
            onClick={handleSeeMore}
            aria-label="See another robot video"
          >
            See more
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Summary

- The component is well-structured and easy to read.
- Focus on accessibility improvements and minor code quality tweaks.
- If the project grows, consider splitting into smaller components.
- No major issues found; keep up the clean and organized approach!
