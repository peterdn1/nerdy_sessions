# Project Gaps and Missing Areas

This document summarizes the current gaps and missing or incomplete areas in the Nerdy Sessions project, based on the present codebase and structure.

---

## 1. Testing Coverage
- **Backend:** There is a `__tests__/` directory, but no visible test runner config or test scripts. Test coverage and types (unit/integration/e2e) are unclear.
- **Frontend:** No test files or test runner config (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress) are present.

## 2. CI/CD & Automation
- No CI/CD configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/`, `circleci/`, `gitlab-ci.yml`) for automated testing, linting, or deployment.

## 3. Containerization & Deployment
- No `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` for local development, testing, or production deployment.
- No deployment scripts or documentation for deploying to cloud providers or platforms.

## 4. Environment Management
- Only `.env.example` is present; no scripts or documentation for managing environment variables across dev, test, and prod.

## 5. API Documentation Exposure
- There is an OpenAPI spec, but no clear route in the backend for serving Swagger UI or Redoc for interactive API docs.

## 6. Security & Best Practices
- No clear evidence of CORS, helmet, or other security middleware in the backend entrypoint.
- Rate limiting is only partially implemented.
- No mention of input validation/sanitization on backend routes.

## 7. Error Handling & Logging
- No explicit error logging or monitoring integration (e.g., Sentry, Winston, Morgan).
- No global error handler or fallback UI for frontend errors.

## 8. Production Build & Readiness
- No scripts or documentation for building and serving the frontend in production.
- No static file serving config for production in the backend.

## 9. User Roles & Permissions
- Only basic authentication is visible; no clear user roles, permissions, or access control logic.

## 10. Monitoring & Analytics
- No integration for analytics (frontend) or monitoring (backend).

## 11. Accessibility & Internationalization
- No mention of accessibility (a11y) checks or internationalization (i18n) in the frontend.

## 12. Linting, Formatting, and Code Quality
- ESLint config is present for the frontend, but no Prettier config or linting for the backend.
- No Husky or lint-staged for pre-commit hooks.

## 13. Documentation
- README files exist, but unclear if they cover all setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
- No code-level documentation or API usage examples.

## 14. Other Potential Gaps
- No scripts for database migrations or seeding (beyond Prisma schema).
- No backup/restore or data export/import scripts.
- No clear separation of dev/test/prod configs.
